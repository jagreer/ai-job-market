    "# Diagnostic Analysis: AI Skills Premium Investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon our descriptive analysis of the AI job market landscape, we now shift to diagnostic analytics to investigate why certain patterns exist in compensation across the AI field. This second phase focuses on identifying the causal factors behind salary variations, with particular emphasis on quantifying skill premiums and understanding how they differ across experience levels. By leveraging more sophisticated analytical techniques, we've moved beyond observing what is happening to explaining why these patterns occur.\n",
    "Our analysis has addressed two key questions so far: (1) Which specific skills or skill combinations command the highest salary premiums, and (2) How these premiums vary across different experience levels from entry to executive positions. To answer these questions, we've performed skills tokenization and frequency analysis to identify high-value technical capabilities, calculated salary differentials for both individual skills and skill combinations, and examined how the value of skills changes throughout career progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagnostic phase required sophisticated data manipulation, including parsing the required_skills column into individual skill flags, standardizing skill terminology, creating derived features to capture skill domain coverage, and analyzing co-occurrence patterns. The insights generated provide STEAMe's platform users with actionable intelligence about which skills deliver the highest return on investment at each career stage, helping learners make more strategic decisions about their professional development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before beginning this analysis, we'll need to ensure our dataset is properly prepared from the descriptive phase, with particular attention to handling the required_skills text field, normalizing education_required categories, and ensuring our numerical variables are appropriately scaled for regression analysis."

    "## 1. Data Preparation and Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "In this diagnostic analysis phase, we'll build upon our descriptive findings to investigate why certain patterns exist in AI job compensation. Before diving into analytical questions, we need to prepare and enhance our dataset, particularly by transforming unstructured skills data into a format suitable for quantitative analysis. This preparation will allow us to isolate the impact of specific skills, educational requirements, and other factors on salary levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first critical step involves parsing the `required_skills` column, which currently contains comma-separated text listings, into individual skill indicators. This transformation will enable us to measure the frequency and salary premium associated with each skill across the AI job market"

    "## Skills Combination Analysis: Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of co-occurring skill pairs in AI job postings reveals several important patterns that help explain salary variations in the market:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python's Dominance**: Python appears in 7 out of 10 top skill combinations, confirming its central role in the AI ecosystem. However, Python alone doesn't necessarily command a salary premium, as most Python combinations show negative salary premiums compared to the overall average.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Value of Specialized Technical Combinations**: The highest salary premium is observed in the Python & Computer Vision combination ($17,219 above average), suggesting that specialization in visual AI applications is particularly valuable. This insight could guide STEAMe's learning pathways for those seeking higher compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Processing Expertise**: The SQL & PyTorch combination shows a significant premium ($8,761), indicating that professionals who can both manage data and implement deep learning models are in high demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Framework Versatility**: The TensorFlow & PyTorch combination commands a modest premium ($3,921), reflecting the value employers place on flexibility across major deep learning frameworks rather than expertise in just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Infrastructure Knowledge**: The Kubernetes & Scala combination shows a positive premium ($3,223), highlighting the value of skills that bridge big data processing and containerized deployment environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Surprising MLOps Gap**: Despite industry buzz around MLOps, the Python & MLOps combination shows the largest negative premium (-$18,637), suggesting that this particular skill pairing may be more common in entry-level or lower-paying roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Compensation Complexity**: The presence of both positive and negative premiums indicates that skill value is contextual—combinations must be strategic rather than random to maximize earning potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide valuable diagnostic insights for STEAMe's platform, helping to explain why certain AI professionals command higher salaries and enabling more targeted career guidance. The data suggests that rather than accumulating random skills, job seekers should focus on strategic combinations that complement each other and align with higher-paying specializations like computer vision or advanced data processing."

The distribution shows that most AI positions require skills from 2-3 domains (324 and 231 jobs respectively), with fewer positions at the extremes of the spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bell-shaped distribution with a slight right skew indicates that employers typically seek candidates with multi-domain expertise rather than hyper-specialists in a single domain. The relatively small number of positions requiring only one domain (113 jobs) suggests that narrow technical focus may limit job opportunities in the AI field. Similarly, the small proportion of jobs requiring skills across 4 domains (48 jobs) indicates that while breadth is valued, expectations of mastery across the entire technical spectrum remain uncommon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For STEAMe's workforce development mission, this insight is particularly valuable—it suggests that training programs should encourage learners to develop complementary skills across 2-3 domains (such as programming languages, ML frameworks, and cloud technologies) rather than concentrating exclusively on a single specialty. This balanced approach to skill development appears to align with the actual structure of job requirements in the AI market, potentially increasing employability for platform users."

    "The relationship between skill domain coverage and compensation reveals a fascinating U-shaped pattern that challenges conventional wisdom about skill breadth in the AI job market. While we might expect a linear relationship where more skill domains consistently lead to higher pay, the data shows a more nuanced reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably, positions requiring coverage of all 5 skill domains command the highest average salary ($202,471), suggesting that true \"full-stack\" AI professionals who can work across programming, ML frameworks, big data, cloud, and visualization domains are highly valued but rare. Interestingly, positions with no classified skill domains also show relatively high compensation ($174,905), potentially representing specialized roles with unique skill requirements outside our defined domains or executive positions where technical skills are complemented by leadership abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle of the distribution (2-3 domains) shows the lowest average salaries ($144,124 and $144,454 respectively), despite being the most common job configurations as revealed in our previous analysis. This indicates a potential oversupply of professionals with moderate skill breadth, driving down the premium for these profiles despite their popularity in job postings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For STEAMe's workforce development mission, these findings suggest two viable paths to maximize earning potential: either develop deep expertise in a highly specialized niche that falls outside common domain classifications, or invest in comprehensive cross-domain proficiency spanning all major skill areas. The typical approach of developing moderate breadth across 2-3 domains, while providing more job opportunities, appears to yield lower compensation on average. This insight could help learners make more strategic decisions about their skill development pathways based on their career and compensation goals."

    "After examining skill combinations, we now focus on individual skills to identify which specific technical capabilities command the highest salary premiums in the AI job market. This analysis will systematically quantify the value of each skill by calculating its frequency in job postings, determining the average salary for positions requiring that skill, and computing the salary differential (premium) it generates. We'll then explore how these premiums vary across experience levels to provide more targeted insights for different career stages. This approach will help STEAMe's users understand which specific skills offer the greatest return on investment for career development and training."

    "\n",
    "The analysis of individual skill premiums reveals fascinating patterns about which technical capabilities command the highest value in the AI job market. Most notably, Java stands out with the highest salary premium of $14,712 (10.2%), despite not being traditionally associated as a primary AI language. This suggests that Java's enterprise integration capabilities may be particularly valuable for deploying AI solutions in production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker follows closely with a premium of $14,244 (9.8%), highlighting the critical importance of containerization skills for AI deployment and scalability. The substantial premiums for both Java and Docker indicate that implementation and operationalization skills may be more financially rewarded than pure algorithmic expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among AI-specific technologies, PyTorch shows the strongest premium at $8,648 (6.0%), significantly outperforming TensorFlow, which actually shows a negative premium of -$1,903 (-1.3%). This suggests a market preference for PyTorch's flexibility and research orientation over TensorFlow's more structured approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control (Git), cloud infrastructure (AWS), and specialized AI domains (NLP, Computer Vision) all command positive premiums in the $4,500-$6,300 range, confirming their value in the ecosystem. Meanwhile, general data technologies like SQL and Spark show slight negative premiums, suggesting these have become baseline expectations rather than differentiating skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "For STEAMe's workforce development initiatives, these findings highlight the importance of including deployment and operationalization skills alongside core AI techniques in training programs, as the highest premiums appear to reward the ability to implement AI solutions in production environments rather than just develop models."

    "After examining individual skills and their varying premiums across experience levels, we now need a more holistic understanding of salary determinants in the AI job market. While our previous analysis revealed valuable insights about specific skills like PyTorch commanding significant premiums at the executive level or AWS being particularly valuable for senior roles, these bivariate relationships don't account for the complex interplay of multiple factors simultaneously affecting compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression analysis allows us to move beyond isolated skill premiums to build a comprehensive model that controls for confounding variables and quantifies the relative importance of different factors. By incorporating experience level, education, industry, company size, skill requirements, and other variables into a unified model, we can identify which factors truly drive salary differences when all else is held constant. This approach helps us distinguish correlation from causation and provides a more nuanced understanding of the AI compensation landscape.\n",

They will help learners understand which factors most significantly impact earning potential, enabling more strategic career planning and skill development.

After confirming no missing values exist in our selected features, we've transformed categorical variables into dummy indicators using one-hot encoding with the drop-first approach to avoid perfect multicollinearity.

After converting all variables to numeric format for compatibility with the VIF calculation, we identify and remove features with extreme multicollinearity (VIF > 20), ensuring our final model will provide more reliable and interpretable estimates of each factor's contribution to AI job compensation."

    "We have successfully prepared a robust dataset for our regression analysis of AI job salary drivers. Through careful feature selection, we identified relevant predictors from our enhanced dataset, including numerical variables, categorical factors, and key skills identified in our premium analysis. We addressed multicollinearity by calculating variance inflation factors and removing highly correlated predictors that could destabilize our model. After identifying a small number of salary outliers, standardizing numerical features for better interpretability, and splitting our data into training and testing sets, we've stored all prepared datasets in a dictionary for easy access in the next step. With this thorough preparation, we're now ready to build a multiple linear regression model using statsmodels that will reveal the key factors driving compensation in the AI job market and quantify their relative importance."

    "Now that we've prepared our data and addressed potential issues like multicollinearity and outliers, we're ready to build a multiple linear regression model to identify the key drivers of AI job salaries. This model will quantify the impact of various factors on compensation while controlling for other variables, allowing us to isolate the unique contribution of each predictor. Unlike our earlier bivariate analyses of skill premiums, regression provides a more comprehensive understanding by simultaneously considering all relevant factors. We'll start with a standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model using statsmodels, which provides detailed statistical outputs including coefficient estimates, confidence intervals, p-values, and overall model fit statistics."

    "## Next Steps and Key Compensation Drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the model's modest explanatory power (R-squared = 0.258), we should take several steps to improve our understanding of AI salary determinants:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Examine Variable Importance**: Identify which specific factors the significant variables (x10, x17, x18, etc.) represent in our dataset. These numeric placeholders obscure the actual predictors driving compensation differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consider Non-Linear Relationships**: The current model assumes linear relationships between predictors and salary. We should explore polynomial terms or interaction effects, particularly between experience level and skills, as our earlier analysis showed skill premiums vary substantially across career stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection Refinement**: Implement a more systematic approach to feature selection, such as stepwise regression or LASSO, to identify the most relevant predictors and create a more useful model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Alternative Modeling Approaches**: Consider more flexible models like random forests or gradient boosting machines that can capture non-linear patterns and complex interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our previous analyses, several key factors appear to drive AI compensation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experience Level**: Executive positions command substantial premiums, particularly when combined with certain technical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-Value Skills**: Java, Docker, and PyTorch showed the highest overall premiums, with PyTorch being particularly valuable at the executive level.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Skill Domain Breadth**: Jobs requiring skills across multiple domains or complete coverage of all domains showed higher compensation than those with moderate skill breadth.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Industry Variation**: Finance, Gaming, and Retail industries offered higher median salaries than others, suggesting industry-specific factors significantly influence compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "By refining our modeling approach and focusing on these key drivers, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that truly determine compensation in the AI job market, providing STEAMe's users with more actionable intelligence for career planning and skill development."
